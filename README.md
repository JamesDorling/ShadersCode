# ShadersCode
The code for the terrain shown in the "Shaders on a Generated Terrain" page on my portfolio.

This is code that I created on my old account, hence the change in name from James-Dorling to JamesDorling. The result of this code can be seen by either running it yourself 
or by looking at the video on my portfolio.
